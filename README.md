**Instructions for use**

To use the Command Line program, first type in which form you want to convert to. The available options are "braille", "ascii", or "unicode". If given "braille", it will expect an ASCII message of all letters and spaces. If given "ascii", it will expect a series of 0's and 1's representing Braille binary that can be converted into ASCII characters. If given "unicode", it will expect an ASCII message and return the Braille message graphically using Braille unicode characters.
